It was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window that he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment, and left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom, you were struck down, it was your doom
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by, you've been hit by, a smooth criminal
Ow!
So they came in to the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window that he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment, and left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom, you were struck down, it was your doom
Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by, you've been struck by, a smooth criminal
Ow!
Ow!
Annie are you okay? Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window, that he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment, and left bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom, you were struck down, it was your doom Annie
Annie are you okay? Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window, that he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment, and left bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom, you were struck down, it was your doom Annie
